# InterestRatePredictions-
This was a project  I prepared for the EdX course Analyst's Edge which I worked on this summer.  In this project, I used R in order to predict whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in a given month.  Please see my wiki link for the full write up!

I applied various skills in this assignment: first, consideration of the use of logistic regression versus CART model when solving a classification problem.  It also showed the types of assessments one must make in evaluating superiority of a model - using accuracy and AUC measures.  Finally, I showed consideration for complexity and an understanding of the over-fitting problem, by selecting the appropriate cp value for my CART tree.
